I'm a scientific collaborator at SUPSI, working in the field of Data Science, specializing in Computational Social Science. I work with data and deal with the whole phase of obtaining, cleaning and studying.
I am particularly involved in misinformation, bias and networks of users and interactions.
Currently very interested in alternative and emerging social platforms like [Bluesky](bsky.app).

**Research**


I am part of the team working on the project CAll for Regulation support In Social MediA
 [CARISMA](https://carisma-project.org/), which aims to work on policies so that they are effective in mitigating the harms of social media actors responsible for abusive and illicit behaviors.
 Within the project I am working on a new version of the social media simulator [SimSoM](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/7/pgae258/7701371.).
I am also involved in collecting and studying data from the Bluesky platform, in which I have a special interest. I am open to any collaboration and data sharing.


**Education**

After obtaining a high school diploma in computer science, I started a three-year degree in computer engineering at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), which I completed in the regular cycle with a thesis titled “[Understanding Misbehavior in COVID19 Discussion on Social Networks and Online Media](https://aris.supsi.ch/bitstreams/7db0f0a5-144e-4167-b353-71cb166a01b2/download)” where I was able to study datasets of human-generated activity related to COVID19 discussion, beginning to approach the study of data and misinformation.
I am currently doing a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science, still at SUPSI.
In addition to the course of study, I had the pleasure of being able to participate in the “[Computational Social Science: Advances, Challenges and Opportunities](https://css.lakecomoschool.org/)” school in Como, Italy, in 2024, where I was able to refine my knowledge in the field of Computational Social Science.
